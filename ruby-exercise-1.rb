#/\W+/ is a "regular expression" - a text-searching pattern.
# /\s+/ The slashes start and end the pattern. \W means "any non-alphabetic character"
# and + means "repeated one or more times"
words = poem.split /\W+/


#Example
puts "There are #{words.count} words"
puts "There are #{words.uniq.count} different words" #uniq removes duplicates

#Exercises
puts "The second through sixth words are #{words[1, 5].join ', '} words"
puts "The first line has #{lines.first.split(/\s+/).count} words in it"

first_stanza_lines = lines[0, 8]
first_stanza = first_stanza_lines.join "\n"
puts "The first stanza has #{first_stanza.split(/\s+/).length} words in it"
#puts "Here is the poem with its lines randomly rearranged #{lines.shuffle.join ""}"
